===PLANNING====
worldmap: every area in the entire game.
room: an individual 'screen' of the game
level: a "random" cluster of rooms, which have to be marked
==============


. wrote down docs
. created layout for WorldMap, Room and Tile


! grab GameRectangle
	! replace keep_in_points with a more general function
	! replace in_points with a more general function


! Create tiles in rooms.
	! be explicit about init, loading, rendering
	uninit, unload, unrender

! Create a basic Camera class which can move around the map.

! perform stress test (level loading)
init and load all the rooms in a level, post-transition
render if it is on-screen
how many rooms is "too much" in terms of waiting?
