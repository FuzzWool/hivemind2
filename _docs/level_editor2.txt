		+ Scrolling in any direction
			+ offset (Rectangle) (movement/size)

+ SliderBox

		+ Press: selects a cell
			+ change the Dropdown name to the cell
			+ close the Dropdown
			+ test: may select cell outside of window
		+ Hover: selects a sub-Dropdown

			! Selecting different tools
				! Glow selected, fade unselected

			#
			! Windows are created right before they open
			! Only one widget is active when Widgets overlap
			! Text is a seperate widget from Button

Problems with UI
	Masking is awkward
	Positioning is awkward
	Alpha preservation is awkward
