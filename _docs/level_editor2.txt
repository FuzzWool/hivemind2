SPEECH
==========================================================
Created for practice. Will likely be scrapped later on.

+ Text Class
Create my own text class.
	
	+ basic Bitmap Text class
		+ basic drawable, loads a texture
		+ reads characters, translates to clips
		+ multiline
		+ caps
		+ grammar

	! advanced Bitmap text class
		+ each letter is an individual class (stores position/letter)


		+ letter spacing
			+ Text Spacing Tool
			+ draw boxes around each letter to contain them
			+ each letter has it's own box
			+ highlight the letter currently being edited
			+ draw a box for each individual letter
			+ load/save the positioning data

			+ Text reads letter spacing data

		~ clean
			~ Text/Letter is split into events/logic


		+ Positioning
			~ vertex_array is created every loop
			~ Text x/y moves each Letter
			~ Letters are only created on Write
			+ text may be moved around
			+ letters may be moved around

		+ Color (transparency)
			* No actual color support

		~ moved files
			~ .window has camera
			~ .graphics has animation, mysprite, rectangle
			~ .graphics has Font, Text

	~ fixed button glitch

	+ basic Speech

LEVEL EDITOR UI
==========================================================

! new UIBox standard
	. communication, states, graphics
	UI Elements are stacked using the same base.
	UI Communication

	+ Box opens and closes

	+ MaskBox
		+ Masking off-box objects
		+ Ignoring controls of completely off-screen objects
		+ Scrolling in any direction
			+ offset (Rectangle) (movement/size)

+ SliderBox
	+ MaskBox, Slider
	~ Slider is sized to MaskBox.offset.size
	+ Slider moves MaskBox.offset
		+ Slider value moves MaskBox.offset.h
		+ Bounded Sliders have proper values

! Tile Tool
	+ ToggleButton
	+ Dropdown
		+ Held and Not-Held
		+ Held: opens cells inside
		+ Press: selects a cell
			+ change the Dropdown name to the cell
			+ close the Dropdown
			+ test: may select cell outside of window
		+ Hover: selects a sub-Dropdown
			+ opens sub-Dropdown contents
			+ hovering another Dropdown in that parent closes it
			+ selecting a cell inside of the Dropdown returns the path to root
			+ names the box by the cell and it's paths

				+ arrow keys move rooms
				+ old cursor position for TileSelector UI

			+ Multi-tile placement
				+ (selector) grabbing multiple tiles
				+ (cursor) applying multiple tiles
